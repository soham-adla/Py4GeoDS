# Vector ToDo 1
# Create buffer of approx 1m # todo create a square buffer ==> cap_style = 3
buffer = place.buffer(0.0015, cap_style = 3)


# Vector ToDo 2
# Print fields name # todo create your own loop to print columns
for column_index in range(railway.shape[1]):      #shape of railway is [n_rows, n_columns]. We can chose the number of columns.
    print(railway.iloc[:,column_index].name)      #iloc to access location by index. Then, use "name" method to get the name of the accessed column.
    
    
# Vector ToDo 3
# todo is central railway (slow & express) & Mumbai-Pune Railway crossed?
# My approach: I did not know whether this problem was to be approached graphically or in some other way. 
# I basically plotted both the railways, and visually observed that they are NOT INTERSECTING.

# Conditions to get the subsets which we want: 
condition_Central_Slow = railway.name == 'Central Railway (Slow)'
condition_Central_Express = railway.name == 'Central Railway (Express)'
condition_Mumbai_Pune = railway.name == 'Mumbai-Pune Railway'
railway_Central_Slow_or_Express = railway[(condition_Central_Express | condition_Central_Slow)] # bitwise OR operator
railway_Mumbai_Pune = railway[condition_Mumbai_Pune]

# Plotting
ax = railway_Mumbai_Pune.plot(colors='r', label='Mumbai-Pune Railway')
railway_Central_Slow_or_Express.plot(colors='b', ax=ax, label='Central Railway (Slow, Express)')
ax.legend(loc='lower right', frameon=False, prop={'size': 8})
